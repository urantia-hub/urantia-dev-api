# Dockerfile for local development and self-hosting.

# Canonical production deploys to Cloudflare Workers (see scripts/deploy.sh and
# wrangler.toml). This image is for anyone who wants to run the API outside of
# Cloudflare — local Docker dev, on-prem deploys, container-based CI, or third-
# party MCP introspection (Glama, etc.). The server boots without a real
# database (tools/list reads only registered tool metadata in src/routes/mcp.ts),
# but actual tool calls require DATABASE_URL plus the other env vars listed in
# CLAUDE.md.
